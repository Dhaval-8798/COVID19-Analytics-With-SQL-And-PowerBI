# COVID19-Analytics-With-SQL-And-PowerBI
An end-to-end data analysis and visualization project using SQL and Power BI

COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard | Data Exploration using PostgreSQL and Power BI | Advanced Visualizations and Insights


---

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **pgAdmin (PostgreSQL)** â€“ for querying and data exploration
- **Power BI Desktop** â€“ for creating visual dashboards
- **SQL** â€“ Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Views, Window Functions, Aggregations

---

##  SQL Data Exploration

Performed in PostgreSQL using raw CSV files (not uploaded for size/privacy). Key operations:

- Created tables from CSV files (`covid_deaths`, `covid_vaccinations`)
- Cleaned nulls and unnecessary columns
- Created Views for percentage metrics
- Calculated key insights like:
  - Global Death Rate
  - Countries with highest death/infection counts
  - Percent of population infected/vaccinated
  - Daily trends in cases, deaths, vaccinations
  - Government stringency vs case trends
